Introduction





```
*Flight fare prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is a data-driven approach aimed at
accurately estimating flight fares by analyzing various factors such as departure time, airline,
source, destination, and duration.
*By leveraging ANN, we can develop predictive models that learn complex patterns from historical
flight data to provide reliable fare estimates for future flights.
*This project focuses on utilizing ANN to optimize pricing strategies for airlines and assist travelers
in planning their trips effectively.
